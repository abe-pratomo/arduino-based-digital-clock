# Arduino-based Digital Clock with Stopwatch and Timer/Alarm Modes
This is an Arduino IDE-based digital clock, complete with timer/alarm and stopwatch modes. It was created in March 2024 to fulfill a big project (Tugas Besar) assignment for the Microprocessor System class in the Electrical Engineering program at Bandung Institute of Technology. It uses an Arduino family microcontroller (an Arduino Nano for the project).

You can find the source code ["source.ino"](https://github.com/abe-pratomo/arduino-based-digital-clock/tree/85a2a71484c9189f11c33efd1d249a6488de6d89/source/source.ino) inside the [source](https://github.com/abe-pratomo/arduino-based-digital-clock/tree/85a2a71484c9189f11c33efd1d249a6488de6d89/source) folder, complete with comments, written in Bahasa Indonesia, to make the code easier to read and understand. You can also find a quick and simple demonstration of the design in the YouTube video below (note that it was narrated in Bahasa Indonesia).
